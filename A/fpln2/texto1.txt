SUBLime (Sustainable Building Lime Applications via Circular Economy 
                   and Biomimetic Approaches) aims to train researchers in multiple 
scientific and engineering fields for a better understanding and development of 
sustainable innovation solutions for mortars, renders and plasters in new construction
 and conservation of the built heritage. This conference will be a key platform for 
dissemination of the SUBLimeâ€™s results, and everyone is invited to participate. This is 
also a great opportunity to discuss and share on-going research on sustainable masonry systems 
and! other challenges.
